        <h2>Encryption Technology Outdated</h2>
        <p>[The obsolescence of encryption technology represents a pervasive threat to electronic network security, often stemming from deficiencies in electronic banking security systems and easily compromised firewalls. This situation can lead to the illicit acquisition of internal data or information by external attackers. The prevalence of outdated encryption technology is especially noticeable in certain traditional and legacy software systems, which frequently lack timely updates and maintenance from technical teams, creating vulnerabilities that can be exploited, particularly in areas such as payment systems, database transmissions, and API communications. 
For instance, in 2020, a significant fraud case occurred in Hong Kong where a group of scammers impersonated PayMe staff to extract transaction passwords, ultimately defrauding victims of HKD 1.5 million. (Singtaohealine, 2024)The fundamental cause of this incident was the outdated encryption technology employed by PayMe, which failed to adequately protect users' data security. A total of 138 victims received calls from individuals claiming to be PayMe personnel, who accurately provided victims' names and banking information, thereby lowering their guard. This led to demands for the disclosure of one-time verification codes and transaction passwords. The scammers subsequently used this information to transfer funds from the victims' accounts and engaged in laundering activities. The early version of the PayMe system lacked a two-factor authentication mechanism, relying solely on SMS for identity verification, thus rendering its encryption technology highly susceptible to attacks.
Additionally, in 2016, hackers successfully infiltrated the banking systems in Vietnam and Bangladesh, stealing millions of dollars. (Taking Action on Climate Change | NWD Sustainability, 2024) These criminals leveraged malware to bypass the local security systems of banks and access user data from SWIFT. Clearly, this incident was a result of the obsolescence of SWIFT and global banking security systems. Perpetrators exploited software vulnerabilities within SWIFTâ€™s Alliance Access to break into banking systems, rendering banks seemingly defenceless in recognizing suspicious fund outflows. This underscores the fragility of banks' encryption systems and credential management; once cybercriminals penetrate these systems, they can freely access internal data and steal sensitive information. Therefore, the obsolescence of encryption technology undoubtedly constitutes a significant electronic network security threat.
