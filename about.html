        <h2>Encryption Technology Outdated</h2>
        <p>
    The obsolescence of encryption technology represents a pervasive threat to electronic network security, often stemming from deficiencies in electronic banking security systems and easily compromised firewalls. This situation can lead to the illicit acquisition of internal data or information by external attackers. The prevalence of outdated encryption technology is especially noticeable in certain traditional and legacy software systems, which frequently lack timely updates and maintenance from technical teams, creating vulnerabilities that can be exploited, particularly in areas such as payment systems, database transmissions, and API communications.
</p>
<p>
    Common examples of obsolete encryption technology and their impacts include:
</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Lack of Two-Factor Authentication:</strong> Some systems do not implement two-factor authentication mechanisms, relying solely on single verification methods (such as SMS), making their encryption technology susceptible to attacks.</li>
    <li><strong>Exploitation of Security Vulnerabilities:</strong> Attackers can leverage security flaws within software to easily penetrate systems and access sensitive information.</li>
    <li><strong>Risk of Data Breaches:</strong> Once encryption technology becomes outdated, internal data can be easily accessed by external attackers, leading to significant security risks.</li>
    <li><strong>Inability to Identify Suspicious Activity:</strong> Outdated systems may fail to effectively recognize and respond to suspicious fund flows, putting banks and organizations at greater risk.</li>

</ul>
<p>
    Obsolete encryption technology not only fails to adequately protect user data but also poses serious security threats. Over time, systems lacking updates become prime targets for attackers, allowing them to easily infiltrate and extract sensitive information. This vulnerability underscores the necessity for banks and other institutions to prioritize the modernization of encryption technologies to prevent data breaches and financial losses. Therefore, the obsolescence of encryption technology undoubtedly constitutes a significant electronic network security threat.

            <h2>Phishing</h2>
<p>Phishing is a common form of online fraud where attackers send false messages to lure victims into providing sensitive personal information, which can then be used to access their bank accounts.</p>

<h2>Types of Phishing</h2>
<p>Phishing comes in various forms, with the most common being:</p>
<ul>
    <li>SMS Phishing</li>
    <li>Email Phishing</li>
    <li>Search Engine Phishing</li>
</ul>

<p>As technology evolves, these techniques become more sophisticated, giving rise to more targeted methods such as Spear Phishing and Vishing. Spear phishing specifically targets individuals, often using the identity of senior executives to send fake internal corporate emails, urging employees to quickly remit money or steal corporate information.</p>

<h2>Phishing Techniques</h2>
<p>Attackers disguise themselves as banking institutions, sending SMS, emails, and links that entice victims to click and enter their information. They may maliciously alter messages from legitimate banks, incorporating logos and misleading phrases like “Your account has been compromised” or offering discounts to lead targets to fake bank login interfaces for identity verification.</p>

<h2>Impact of Artificial Intelligence</h2>
<p>With the advancement of artificial intelligence, phishing attacks have evolved to target specific individuals more effectively. Attackers can create realistic videos and audio through synthetic images and voice alteration, increasing the victim's trust. They may also impersonate credible banking institutions over the phone to trick users into providing SMS verification codes or security information. By altering URLs, they can evade technical defenses, making phishing attacks even more challenging to counter.</p>

        
<h2>Man-in-the-middle attacks</h2>
        <p>A Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack in e-banking is a cyberattack where a malicious actor secretly intercepts and potentially alters the communication between a bank customer and the bank’s online system. The attacker positions themselves between the two parties, making the user believe they are communicating directly with the bank, while in reality, the attacker captures sensitive data such as login credentials, account information, and transaction details. This stolen data can then be used for unauthorized transactions, identity theft, or financial fraud.</p>

        <h2>How MITM Attacks Are Carried Out in E-Banking</h2>
        <li><Strong>Wi-Fi Eavesdropping and Fake Hotspots:</Strong>Attackers set up rogue Wi-Fi networks with legitimate-sounding names in public places. When users connect, the attacker intercepts all data transmitted, including banking credentials and transaction data.</li> 
        <li><strong>Malware on Mobile Devices:</strong>Attackers implant malware on smartphones that intercept and manipulate banking app communications, enabling them to hijack transactions or steal data without the user’s knowledge.</li>
        <li><strong>Packet Sniffing Tools:</strong>Delivered through phishing or malicious websites, these tools monitor network traffic to capture unencrypted data from banking sessions.</li>
<h2>Impact of MITM Attacks in E-Banking</h2>
        <li>Unauthorized fund transfers and financial theft by altering transaction details.</li>
        <li>Theft of personal and banking credentials leading to identity fraud.</li>
        <li>Loss of customer trust and damage to the bank’s reputation.</li>
        <li>Operational disruptions as banks investigate and mitigate breaches.</li>
