        <h2>Solution 1</h2>
<p><p>
    Despite the inevitability of the challenges posed by outdated encryption technology, many electronic wallet companies today are continuously innovating and launching various new verification and protective systems to mitigate associated risks. Here are some key solutions being implemented:
</p>
<p><strong>Preventive Measures</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Strengthening Identity Verification:</strong>
        Users can effectively reduce risks by enhancing identity verification and access controls.
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):</strong> This widely adopted method requires users to provide two different authentication factors to confirm their identity. For example, when making a large online purchase, users may need to confirm the transaction through their mobile banking app.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Mobile Security Features:</strong>
        Banks like HSBC require users to set a mobile security password and undergo biometric verification when logging into their online banking systems. This ensures that transactions are executed by the genuine user, even if a fraudster obtains the user's credit card information.
    </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Remedial Measures</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Account Freezing Features:</strong>
        Many banks have implemented features that allow them to freeze accounts automatically if suspicious activity is detected, such as frequent large transactions. This prevents unauthorized transactions and mitigates potential losses.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Proactive Notifications:</strong>
        Banks often send notifications regarding suspicious transactions via SMS, promptly informing customers of their credit card expenditure records. This real-time alert system helps customers remain vigilant about their credit card activity and make informed decisions about freezing their cards to avert losses.
    </li>
</ul>
    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>
    Updating encryption technology is critical for safeguarding financial assets and protecting users' data from potential breaches. Electronic banks must actively enhance and refine their security measures to tackle the evolving threats posed by cyber-attacks. It is equally important for users to maintain a high level of security awareness and regularly update their personal security settings as a proactive defense against such threats.
</p></p>

<h2>Solution 2</h2>
<p><strong style="font-size: 1.2em;">Enhancing Security with Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)</strong></p>
<p>Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is a powerful tool in the fight against phishing attacks, providing an extra layer of security for users. By requiring individuals to verify their identity through at least two different methods, MFA significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized access.</p>

<h3>How MFA Works</h3>
<p>MFA combines three key factors to confirm a user's identity:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Something You Know:</strong> This typically refers to a password or a security question that only the user should know.</li>
    <li><strong>Something You Have:</strong> This involves a verification code sent via SMS or generated by an authentication app, adding an additional layer of security.</li>
    <li><strong>Something You Are:</strong> This factor uses biometric verification, such as fingerprints or facial recognition, which are much harder for attackers to replicate.</li>
</ul>
<p>By implementing these multiple verification methods, the chances of data leakage decrease. Even if a phisher manages to obtain a password, they would still need additional credentials to gain access.</p>

<h3>Real-Time Alerts</h3>
<p>MFA systems are designed to notify users immediately if abnormal login attempts are detected. If a stranger tries to access an account, the user receives an alert via SMS or email, allowing them to take action and block unauthorized access. This responsiveness helps mitigate potential losses from phishing attacks.</p>

<h3>Challenges of MFA</h3>
<p>While MFA offers enhanced security, it is not without its challenges:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>MFA Fatigue Attacks:</strong> Attackers may bombard users with verification requests to wear them down, hoping they will eventually click through without verifying.</li>
    <li><strong>SMS Vulnerabilities:</strong> If a phisher gains access to a user's phone number, they can intercept SMS verification codes, increasing the risk of unauthorized access.</li>
    <li><strong>User Resistance:</strong> Some users may find the MFA process cumbersome, especially during urgent transactions. Those unfamiliar with mobile apps may also face technical difficulties.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>MFA is an effective security measure that strengthens defenses against phishing attacks. However, it's essential to remain aware of its limitations and continue to educate users about best practices in digital security. By combining MFA with user awareness and training, organizations can create a more secure online environment for everyone.</p>

<h2>Solutions to Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks in E-Banking</h2>

<p>To effectively protect e-banking apps from MITM attacks, a multi-layered security approach is essential. Key solutions include:</p>

<h3>1. Implement End-to-End Encryption</h3>
<p>Encrypt all data transferred between the user’s device and the bank’s servers to ensure that intercepted data remains unreadable to attackers. This prevents unauthorized parties from accessing sensitive information during transmission.</p>

<h3>2. Use Strong Certificate Validation and Certificate Pinning</h3>
<p>Properly implement SSL/TLS certificate validation to verify server identities and prevent attackers from using fake certificates. Certificate pinning restricts the app to trust only specific certificates, blocking malicious proxies or spoofed certificates that facilitate MITM attacks.</p>

<h3>3. Regular Security Audits and Updates</h3>
<p>Conduct frequent security audits and penetration testing to identify and fix vulnerabilities before attackers exploit them. Regularly release app updates and patches to address emerging threats and improve security mechanisms.</p>

<h3>4. Mobile App Shielding and Anti-Tampering</h3>
<p>Protect the app against static and dynamic tampering, reverse engineering, and unauthorized code modifications. This reduces the risk of attackers injecting malicious code or bypassing security controls that could enable MITM attacks.</p>

<h3>5. Behavioral Analytics and Anomaly Detection</h3>
<p>Monitor user behavior patterns to detect suspicious activities or anomalies that may indicate an ongoing MITM attack or account compromise. Real-time detection helps prevent fraudulent transactions and unauthorized access.</p>

<h3>6. Avoiding Public Wi-Fi</h3>
<p>Avoiding public Wi-Fi is one of the most effective ways to protect yourself from Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks and other cyber threats when using e-banking services. Public Wi-Fi networks, especially those that are unsecured or open, pose significant risks because they allow hackers to intercept data transmitted between your device and the internet.<p>

<h3>7. Secure Data Storage on Device</h3>
<p>Encrypt sensitive data stored locally on the device to protect it in case of device loss or theft, preventing attackers from extracting valuable information even if they gain physical access.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>By combining these technical safeguards—strong encryption, robust certificate handling, continuous monitoring, and secure coding practices—banks can significantly reduce the risk of MITM attacks and protect their customers’ financial data and trust.</p>
