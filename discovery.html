        <h2>Solution 1</h2>
<p><p>
    Despite the inevitability of the challenges posed by outdated encryption technology, many electronic wallet companies today are continuously innovating and launching various new verification and protective systems to mitigate associated risks. Here are some key solutions being implemented:
</p>
<p><strong>Preventive Measures</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Strengthening Identity Verification:</strong>
        Users can effectively reduce risks by enhancing identity verification and access controls.
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):</strong> This widely adopted method requires users to provide two different authentication factors to confirm their identity. For example, when making a large online purchase, users may need to confirm the transaction through their mobile banking app.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Mobile Security Features:</strong>
        Banks like HSBC require users to set a mobile security password and undergo biometric verification when logging into their online banking systems. This ensures that transactions are executed by the genuine user, even if a fraudster obtains the user's credit card information.
    </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Remedial Measures</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Account Freezing Features:</strong>
        Many banks have implemented features that allow them to freeze accounts automatically if suspicious activity is detected, such as frequent large transactions. This prevents unauthorized transactions and mitigates potential losses.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Proactive Notifications:</strong>
        Banks often send notifications regarding suspicious transactions via SMS, promptly informing customers of their credit card expenditure records. This real-time alert system helps customers remain vigilant about their credit card activity and make informed decisions about freezing their cards to avert losses.
    </li>
</ul>
    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>
    Updating encryption technology is critical for safeguarding financial assets and protecting users' data from potential breaches. Electronic banks must actively enhance and refine their security measures to tackle the evolving threats posed by cyber-attacks. It is equally important for users to maintain a high level of security awareness and regularly update their personal security settings as a proactive defense against such threats.
</p></p>

<h2>Solution 2</h2>
<p>Enhancing Security with Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)</p>
<p>Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is a powerful tool in the fight against phishing attacks, providing an extra layer of security for users. By requiring individuals to verify their identity through at least two different methods, MFA significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized access.</p>

<h3>How MFA Works</h3>
<p>MFA combines three key factors to confirm a user's identity:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Something You Know:</strong> This typically refers to a password or a security question that only the user should know.</li>
    <li><strong>Something You Have:</strong> This involves a verification code sent via SMS or generated by an authentication app, adding an additional layer of security.</li>
    <li><strong>Something You Are:</strong> This factor uses biometric verification, such as fingerprints or facial recognition, which are much harder for attackers to replicate.</li>
</ul>
<p>By implementing these multiple verification methods, the chances of data leakage decrease. Even if a phisher manages to obtain a password, they would still need additional credentials to gain access.</p>

<h3>Real-Time Alerts</h3>
<p>MFA systems are designed to notify users immediately if abnormal login attempts are detected. If a stranger tries to access an account, the user receives an alert via SMS or email, allowing them to take action and block unauthorized access. This responsiveness helps mitigate potential losses from phishing attacks.</p>

<h3>Challenges of MFA</h3>
<p>While MFA offers enhanced security, it is not without its challenges:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>MFA Fatigue Attacks:</strong> Attackers may bombard users with verification requests to wear them down, hoping they will eventually click through without verifying.</li>
    <li><strong>SMS Vulnerabilities:</strong> If a phisher gains access to a user's phone number, they can intercept SMS verification codes, increasing the risk of unauthorized access.</li>
    <li><strong>User Resistance:</strong> Some users may find the MFA process cumbersome, especially during urgent transactions. Those unfamiliar with mobile apps may also face technical difficulties.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>MFA is an effective security measure that strengthens defenses against phishing attacks. However, it's essential to remain aware of its limitations and continue to educate users about best practices in digital security. By combining MFA with user awareness and training, organizations can create a more secure online environment for everyone.</p>
